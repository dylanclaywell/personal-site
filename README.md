# Dylan Claywell's Personal Site

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using the Typescript template.

It uses Tailwind CSS for styles, and features some simple artwork I created myself. Have fun poking around!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

### `yarn style:fix`

Runs Prettier on all of the applicable files in the project for consistent code styling and formatting.

### `yarn lint`

Runs ESLint on all of the applicable files in the project for quality control.
